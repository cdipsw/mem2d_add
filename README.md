# mem2d_add
Add 2D MEM spectra to CDIP waveCDF datasets

Fortran code which calculates 2D spectral estimates for CDIP buoy observations using the Maximum Entropy Method.
Input comes directly from the CDIP THREDDS server, output is a local netCDF file which includes the 2D spectra.

Please see docs/install.txt for use instructions, and docs/info.txt for details on the MEM estimates.
